 Instruction guide on how to create a local pull request and how to merge it to a remote repository.

1. In your github project, locate the clone URL in found in the brach you wanted to contribute. You can find it by clicking the code button. In this guide we will use destop as our destination of cloning. In your gitbash terminal type:
	cd desktop //to set our destinate folder for cloning
	git clone 'clone-url' //this will clone the selected branch from github to your desktop
2. After cloning, we need to switch from main branch to our destination branch:
	cd 'local repository directory' //this will allow us to enter in the cloned repo
	git branch -a //this will display both local and remote branches in you repository
	git switch 'selected_branch' //this will select the desired branch to update/contribute
	git branch //just to make sure if the branch is successfully switched, it will be highleted
3. Make sure to add your files in the local folder created after cloning. If files already in the folder, proceed to step 4.
4. Updating your current local branch with the latest changes from the selected_branch in the remote repository.
	git status //used to display the state of the working directory
	git add . //is used to stage all the changes in the current directory and its subdirectories, preparing them for the next commit
	git status //this is just to make sure and see if the files were added
5. Commit your changes
	git commit -m 'commit_description' //used to create a commit with a message that describes the changes being committed
	git push -u origin 'selected_branch' //used to push a local branch to the remote repository and set it up to track the remote branch
6. After completion, check your repository in github site, it must be successfully updated with the following files you added.
